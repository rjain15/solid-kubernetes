# Introduction

This is a guide to take your applications to a kubernetes platform. The guide walks through the various steps you have to either build, configure and deploy on kubernetes to give you a complete production ready application.

The [docs](./docs) folder has various steps you would take to deploy your application to kubernetes. As the kubernetes platform evolves, the steps will either change or vendors will build the configuration steps.

The official website is hosted on Netlify at [sk8s.kubelabs.io](https://sk8s.kubelabs.io)

## Motivation

We started on the kubernetes journey with few big customers - Finance/Mortgage, Food and Retail industries. And we were tasked with the same challenge, build a platform and move apps used by 100s of customers today to production, without disruption.

## Goals

We have few goals different from any other kubernetes blogs, awesome lists or documentation.

  1. Cut the noise
  2. Focus on path to production
  3. Incrementally learn and
  4. Always keep this path fresh

This is a vendor neutral guide, so how you implement these concerns on you path, will vary. If you follow this,you will reach to production.
