# Introduction

This is a guide to take your applications to a kubernetes platform. The guide walks through the various steps you have to either build, configure and deploy on kubernetes to give you a complete production ready application.

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/) Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration engine for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. The open source project is hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

[Awesome Kubernetes](https://github.com/ramitsurana/awesome-kubernetes) is a curated list of kubernetes sources. Kubernetes and other associated CNCF projects are the most dynamic changing OSS projects on github.
In this list there are close to 30 ways to install kubernetes, 10 public/private cloud providers, 50+ associated projects including CI/CD, Security, Monitoring, Testing, Secrets managements, Configuration, Service Discovery. 

Additionally the [CNCF](www.cncf.org) project has close to 20+ projects, including Prometheus, Envoy, Jaegar, Helm etc. 

If you are any of the personas - Developer, Architect or Cloud Engineer, your challenge is trying to take your apps to production and run them with the same SLO/SLI as before. And the landscape is changing everyday - new vendors are coming and new projects are incubating. 

## Motivation

We started on the kubernetes journey with few big customers - Finance/Mortgage, Food and Retail industries. And we were tasked with the same challenge, build a platform and move apps used by 100s of customers today to production, without disruption.

## Goals

We have few goals different from any other kubernetes blogs, awesome lists or documentation.

  1. Cut the noise
  2. Focus on path to production
  3. Incrementally learn and
  4. Always keep this path fresh

This is a vendor neutral guide, so how you implement these concerns on you path, will vary. If you follow this,you will reach to production.
